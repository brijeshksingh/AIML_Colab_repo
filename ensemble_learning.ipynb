We need to collect this data item in all Annuals and for only in Highest PEO.\\n2. This is Income Statement Nature Data item\\n3. We need to collect this data item in all templates \\n4. Other than document currency also we need to collect for this data item in the absence of reported currency\\nCollection policy:\\nWe are collecting data based on below accounting GAAP:      \\n1. Operating lease commitments-off-balance sheet (other than US GAAP i.e. IFRS)\\n2. Operating lease Commitments-On& off-balance sheet (US GAAP)\\n -off-balance sheet includes short Term Leases and Low Value leases\\n  -On-balance sheet includes operating lease obligations recognized in the balance sheet\\nTagging:\\nOperating Lease Obligations for future years 1- 5 are collected as OLO \\u2013 OLO5, thereafter portion as OLOR, and Total as TOLO.  \\nIn the case of the US GAAP, imputed interest (difference between minimum lease and balance sheet value) for PVAOL \\n\\nPoints to be considered while extracting the values (Policies): \\nI. Order of priority:\\n1. Gross Vs Net Operating Lease Obligations:\\n       a. Collect \\u201cGross Operating Lease Obligations \\u201c(before deducting Sub Lease) under OLOs.\\n       b. If company reports \\u201cNet Operating Lease Obligations \\u201c(After deducting Sub Lease), add back sublease income. \\n      c. In the absence of Gross Operating Lease Obligations (Sub Lease income not reported separately), collect Net Operating Lease Obligations, as OLOs. \\n2. Year wise Vs Range Wise Obligations\\n     a. If both year wise and range wise obligations are given preference will be given to year wise Obligations.\\n     b. In the absence of year wise, collect range wise Obligations. (We need to calculate and tag them equally as per the given range.)\\n3. Maximum Availability \\n\\n     a. If Operating Lease Obligations are reported in two places like Commitments and Contractual, extract maximum Value. \\n\\nII More than one Lease exists in the document:\\n1) If more than one lease exits in the document, collect sum of all operating lease obligations.\\n2) When two or more Leases exist in the document, but Obligations are reported for only one lease then we can tag partial Lease Obligations for OLOs.\\n\\nIII Thereafter Policy:\\n1)If company reports maturities for undefined periods starting below 5 years like \\u2018due after one year\\u2019 or \\u2018due more than 2 years\\u2019 or \\u20183rd year and beyond\\u2019 etc., we collect the same with obligations \\u2018After 5 Years\\u2019 data item for all these data sets (i.e. OLOs, LTDs/LTDBs, CLs/LTDCs, TLTDs/TLTDBs, CONTRs and SIOLs). \\n2) When \\u20185th and Thereafter\\u2019 portion is together reported in notes, but in some other place we know the \\u2018thereafter\\u2019 portion value, then we can calculate and tag \\u20185th year\\u2019 and \\u2018Thereafter\\u2019 separately. \\n3) When \\u2018Total\\u2019 and \\u2018Up to 5 years\\u2019 Obligations are reported where \\u2018Total\\u2019 is not matching with the sum of Obligations, then we can tag difference amount as OLOR. \\n4) In Commitments, Year wise Obligations are available up to 5 years where \\u2018Total\\u2019 and \\u2018Thereafter\\u2019 portion is not reported, then check if Obligations match with Contractual. If they match, extract \\u2018Thereafter\\u2019 portion from Contractual Table. \\n5) In the US GAAP, current and non-current portion only reported in the balance sheet or notes then collect current portion for OLO and non-current portion for OLOR \\nIV TOLO:\\n1) Obligations are reported including Total for one Lease and Only Total for another Lease. \\na. Obligations including Total reported \\u2013 OLO for year wise obligations & TOLO for Total. \\nb. Only Total reported \\u2013 Only TOLO for the total. \\n2) Note - In this case, the sum of year wise obligations extracted will not match with the extracted Total. \\n3) Two Leases exist in the document. One Lease has Obligations and Total and another Lease has only Obligations (total is not reported). In this case we can tag calculated value for TOLO. \\n4) When reported total is not matching with the Obligations and \\n      a. If total > obligations, tag reported Total as TOLO. \\n      b. If total < obligations, ignore Total. \\n5) In Commitments, Year wise Obligations are reported up to thereafter, but total is not reported. In Contractual total is reported but it is not matching with the calculated total in commitments.\\n     In this case we can\\u2019t tag Total. (Even with difference of 1). Tag Total when the calculated Total matches with the reported total \\nV Other Policies: \\n1. Collect only continued operations. \\n  When combined values of Continued and Discontinued Operations are reported and segregation of the same is not possible then we need to ignore such data.  \\n2. Cancellable and Non \\u2013 Cancellable\\nWe will consider Cancellable and Non-Cancellable Operating leases under OLOs. Preference should be given to combined values.\\n3. Subsequent Event\\nWe should collect values for OLO\\u2019s even for subsequent event information reported by the Company. \\n\\n4. Country Specific\\nJapan\\n While processing Japanese documents, company reports \\u2018obligations for finance lease\\u2019 under Notes and specifies that \\u2018ownership will not be transferred to the lessee\\u2019. In this case, we have to consider such Finance lease obligations as Operating Lease (OLO\\u2019s).\\nFinland\\nWhile processing Finland country documents, company reports \\u2018lease obligations\\u2019 under the \\u2018Contingent Liabilities\\u2019 head. We should consider such values as Operating Lease (OLO\\u2019s).\\nCountry specific (Chinese) :  Need to update all obligations related data set\\n \\nWe observed that Chinese years (which is calculated from 1912)  are reported in the documents and  same numbers are translated which creates difficulty for users to recognize the English calendar year.\\nFor instance \\u2018Republic of China 103 annual (Chinese string: \\u6c11\\u570b103\\u5e74\\u5ea6)\\u2019 or  \\u2018103 (Chinese string: \\u4e00\\u25cb\\u4e09) for the English Calendar year 2014 (1911+103 =2014).\\n \\nNote: Translation changes have been done until year 2050 by the linguist.\\n \\nExample:\\n \\n# No Chinese Translation finalized\\n1 101\\u5e74 \\n2 102\\u5e74 2013\\n3 103\\u5e74 2014\\n4 104\\u5e74 20122015\\n5 105\\u5e74 2016\\n6 106\\u5e74 2017\\n\\n5. Zero Tagging Policy:\\nWe should tag Zero for OLO\\u2019s when company reports \\u2018No lease exists\\u2019 or \\u2018Future total Operating Lease Obligations as Zero\\u2019. \\n6. Expiry Dates:\\nWe should not consider expiry dates, when Lease obligations reported year wise / range wise.\\nIn absence of Year wise/range wise obligations, we can consider expiry dates for tagging OLO\\u2019s. \\n7. Month to month basis:\\nIf company reports monthly future payments of operating lease, then we are required to do calculation for future periods based on lease entering period and lease expiry dates. \\n8. Operating lease & Other\\n1) When pure Operating Lease obligations are reported, collect only 'Operating Lease Obligations' with OLOs and ignore 'Operating Lease & Other Obligations'.\\n2) When pure Operating Lease obligations are not reported, collect \\u2018Operating Lease & Other Obligations' with OLOs (only in the case of combined obligations). \\n3) If company reports \\u201cGround/Land Lease/\\u201d, consider them for OLO\\u2019s\\n4) In all the below cases, we need to collect the as reported obligations for Operating Lease related set of data items.\\n\\u2022 In some documents, companies reported operating lease obligations inclusive of deferred rent values, etc. and relevant information is reporting under sub-notes and in other areas.\\n\\u2022 Some of the companies are reporting operating lease obligations inclusive of provisions & on-balance sheet items. \\n\\nOther points in line with Revised Policy:\\n1) If company reports only Rental Obligations, we need to collect these values with OLOs. \\n2) If company reports both \\u201cRental Obligations\\u201d and \\u201cOperating Lease\\u201d separately, we have to consider both under OLOs. If company reports combined values of \\u201cOperating Lease and Rental obligations\\u201d, we need to collect combined values with OLOs. \\n3) If company has reported combined obligations i.e. \\u201cRental & Other Obligations\\u201d; we have to consider it under OLOs.\\n4) If company has reported combined obligations i.e. Rental & Others Obligations; also reported pure \\u201cOperating Lease obligations\\u201d; we have to consider both under OLOs.\\n5) If company reports two Operating Leases, one is pure Operating Lease and the other is combined with Other Obligations, then we need to tag both line items with OLOs.\\n6) If Company reports \\u2018combined\\u2019 values of \\u2018Operating Lease and Other Obligations\\u2019 under Contractual Obligations head and reported pure Operating Lease Obligations under commitments, we need to consider pure Operating Lease obligations for OLOs from commitments. We have to ignore combined values (i.e. Operating Lease & Other Obligations) from Contractual Obligations.  No need to tag calculated values for CONTR\\u2019s in this case. \\n7) If company has reported pure \\u201cOperating Lease obligation\\u201d, but not having full length maturities (i.e. 4th year and thereafter etc.) and also reported \\u201cOperating Lease & other obligations\\u201d with full length maturities; we can collect pure \\u201cOperating Lease obligations\\u201d with the available future maturities.\\n8) If company has reported pure operating lease information in description form with monthly or yearly payments along with expiry date (Where we need to do calculation here); and also reported combined values of operating lease and other obligations at another head (in year wise or range wise maturities), here we can collect combined values of operating lease and other obligations for OLOs. No need to tag calculated values for OLO\\u2019s in this case.\\n(We should collect Royalty agreements, Software Data Licenses, Programming Commitments and Concession Fees for CONTRs, if these are reported under Contractual Obligations head.)\\n9. Combined values of Capital and Operating Lease:\\n1. We should collect combined value in USGAAP document only for OLO\\u2019s\\n10. Original Vs Amendment\\nWhile processing the Amendment document if there is no data, then we can collect it from original if NI\\\\ Tax\\\\ are same in both documents.\\nMore than one Amendment : We always Extracts data from original only. Don\\u2019t collect data from recent amendments.\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Table / Snippet / Both\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Both\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"More than One Data Item Combined\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"No\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Search Strings\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Lease_x000D_\\nLeasing_x000D_\\nOperating lease_x000D_\\nRent_x000D_\\nRental_x000D_\\nObligation_x000D_\\nContractual\\nCommitment\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Table Section Header\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Headers_x000D_\\n_x000D_\\nAs a lessee_x000D_\\nAS LESSEE_x000D_\\nAs Lessee-Operating leases_x000D_\\nAssets taken on Lease_x000D_\\nBusiness Lease Commitment matters_x000D_\\nCharters-in_x000D_\\nCommitment under Operating Leases Where the Group Is a Lessee_x000D_\\nCommitments_x000D_\\nCommitments -

We need to collect this data item in all Annuals and for only in Highest PEO.\\n2. This is Income Statement Nature Data item\\n3. We need to collect this data item in all templates \\n4. Other than document currency also we need to collect for this data item in the absence of reported currency\\nCollection policy:\\nWe are collecting data based on below accounting GAAP:      \\n1. Operating lease commitments-off-balance sheet (other than US GAAP i.e. IFRS)\\n2. Operating lease Commitments-On& off-balance sheet (US GAAP)\\n -off-balance sheet includes short Term Leases and Low Value leases\\n  -On-balance sheet includes operating lease obligations recognized in the balance sheet\\nTagging:\\nOperating Lease Obligations for future years 1- 5 are collected as OLO \\u2013 OLO5, thereafter portion as OLOR, and Total as TOLO.  \\nIn the case of the US GAAP, imputed interest (difference between minimum lease and balance sheet value) for PVAOL \\n\\nPoints to be considered while extracting the values (Policies): \\nI. Order of priority:\\n1. Gross Vs Net Operating Lease Obligations:\\n       a. Collect \\u201cGross Operating Lease Obligations \\u201c(before deducting Sub Lease) under OLOs.\\n       b. If company reports \\u201cNet Operating Lease Obligations \\u201c(After deducting Sub Lease), add back sublease income. \\n      c. In the absence of Gross Operating Lease Obligations (Sub Lease income not reported separately), collect Net Operating Lease Obligations, as OLOs. \\n2. Year wise Vs Range Wise Obligations\\n     a. If both year wise and range wise obligations are given preference will be given to year wise Obligations.\\n     b. In the absence of year wise, collect range wise Obligations. (We need to calculate and tag them equally as per the given range.)\\n3. Maximum Availability \\n\\n     a. If Operating Lease Obligations are reported in two places like Commitments and Contractual, extract maximum Value. \\n\\nII More than one Lease exists in the document:\\n1) If more than one lease exits in the document, collect sum of all operating lease obligations.\\n2) When two or more Leases exist in the document, but Obligations are reported for only one lease then we can tag partial Lease Obligations for OLOs.\\n\\nIII Thereafter Policy:\\n1)If company reports maturities for undefined periods starting below 5 years like \\u2018due after one year\\u2019 or \\u2018due more than 2 years\\u2019 or \\u20183rd year and beyond\\u2019 etc., we collect the same with obligations \\u2018After 5 Years\\u2019 data item for all these data sets (i.e. OLOs, LTDs/LTDBs, CLs/LTDCs, TLTDs/TLTDBs, CONTRs and SIOLs). \\n2) When \\u20185th and Thereafter\\u2019 portion is together reported in notes, but in some other place we know the \\u2018thereafter\\u2019 portion value, then we can calculate and tag \\u20185th year\\u2019 and \\u2018Thereafter\\u2019 separately. \\n3) When \\u2018Total\\u2019 and \\u2018Up to 5 years\\u2019 Obligations are reported where \\u2018Total\\u2019 is not matching with the sum of Obligations, then we can tag difference amount as OLOR. \\n4) In Commitments, Year wise Obligations are available up to 5 years where \\u2018Total\\u2019 and \\u2018Thereafter\\u2019 portion is not reported, then check if Obligations match with Contractual. If they match, extract \\u2018Thereafter\\u2019 portion from Contractual Table. \\n5) In the US GAAP, current and non-current portion only reported in the balance sheet or notes then collect current portion for OLO and non-current portion for OLOR \\nIV TOLO:\\n1) Obligations are reported including Total for one Lease and Only Total for another Lease. \\na. Obligations including Total reported \\u2013 OLO for year wise obligations & TOLO for Total. \\nb. Only Total reported \\u2013 Only TOLO for the total. \\n2) Note - In this case, the sum of year wise obligations extracted will not match with the extracted Total. \\n3) Two Leases exist in the document. One Lease has Obligations and Total and another Lease has only Obligations (total is not reported). In this case we can tag calculated value for TOLO. \\n4) When reported total is not matching with the Obligations and \\n      a. If total > obligations, tag reported Total as TOLO. \\n      b. If total < obligations, ignore Total. \\n5) In Commitments, Year wise Obligations are reported up to thereafter, but total is not reported. In Contractual total is reported but it is not matching with the calculated total in commitments.\\n     In this case we can\\u2019t tag Total. (Even with difference of 1). Tag Total when the calculated Total matches with the reported total \\nV Other Policies: \\n1. Collect only continued operations. \\n  When combined values of Continued and Discontinued Operations are reported and segregation of the same is not possible then we need to ignore such data.  \\n2. Cancellable and Non \\u2013 Cancellable\\nWe will consider Cancellable and Non-Cancellable Operating leases under OLOs. Preference should be given to combined values.\\n3. Subsequent Event\\nWe should collect values for OLO\\u2019s even for subsequent event information reported by the Company. \\n\\n4. Country Specific\\nJapan\\n While processing Japanese documents, company reports \\u2018obligations for finance lease\\u2019 under Notes and specifies that \\u2018ownership will not be transferred to the lessee\\u2019. In this case, we have to consider such Finance lease obligations as Operating Lease (OLO\\u2019s).\\nFinland\\nWhile processing Finland country documents, company reports \\u2018lease obligations\\u2019 under the \\u2018Contingent Liabilities\\u2019 head. We should consider such values as Operating Lease (OLO\\u2019s).\\nCountry specific (Chinese) :  Need to update all obligations related data set\\n \\nWe observed that Chinese years (which is calculated from 1912)  are reported in the documents and  same numbers are translated which creates difficulty for users to recognize the English calendar year.\\nFor instance \\u2018Republic of China 103 annual (Chinese string: \\u6c11\\u570b103\\u5e74\\u5ea6)\\u2019 or  \\u2018103 (Chinese string: \\u4e00\\u25cb\\u4e09) for the English Calendar year 2014 (1911+103 =2014).\\n \\nNote: Translation changes have been done until year 2050 by the linguist.\\n \\nExample:\\n \\n# No Chinese Translation finalized\\n1 101\\u5e74 \\n2 102\\u5e74 2013\\n3 103\\u5e74 2014\\n4 104\\u5e74 20122015\\n5 105\\u5e74 2016\\n6 106\\u5e74 2017\\n\\n5. Zero Tagging Policy:\\nWe should tag Zero for OLO\\u2019s when company reports \\u2018No lease exists\\u2019 or \\u2018Future total Operating Lease Obligations as Zero\\u2019. \\n6. Expiry Dates:\\nWe should not consider expiry dates, when Lease obligations reported year wise / range wise.\\nIn absence of Year wise/range wise obligations, we can consider expiry dates for tagging OLO\\u2019s. \\n7. Month to month basis:\\nIf company reports monthly future payments of operating lease, then we are required to do calculation for future periods based on lease entering period and lease expiry dates. \\n8. Operating lease & Other\\n1) When pure Operating Lease obligations are reported, collect only 'Operating Lease Obligations' with OLOs and ignore 'Operating Lease & Other Obligations'.\\n2) When pure Operating Lease obligations are not reported, collect \\u2018Operating Lease & Other Obligations' with OLOs (only in the case of combined obligations). \\n3) If company reports \\u201cGround/Land Lease/\\u201d, consider them for OLO\\u2019s\\n4) In all the below cases, we need to collect the as reported obligations for Operating Lease related set of data items.\\n\\u2022 In some documents, companies reported operating lease obligations inclusive of deferred rent values, etc. and relevant information is reporting under sub-notes and in other areas.\\n\\u2022 Some of the companies are reporting operating lease obligations inclusive of provisions & on-balance sheet items. \\n\\nOther points in line with Revised Policy:\\n1) If company reports only Rental Obligations, we need to collect these values with OLOs. \\n2) If company reports both \\u201cRental Obligations\\u201d and \\u201cOperating Lease\\u201d separately, we have to consider both under OLOs. If company reports combined values of \\u201cOperating Lease and Rental obligations\\u201d, we need to collect combined values with OLOs. \\n3) If company has reported combined obligations i.e. \\u201cRental & Other Obligations\\u201d; we have to consider it under OLOs.\\n4) If company has reported combined obligations i.e. Rental & Others Obligations; also reported pure \\u201cOperating Lease obligations\\u201d; we have to consider both under OLOs.\\n5) If company reports two Operating Leases, one is pure Operating Lease and the other is combined with Other Obligations, then we need to tag both line items with OLOs.\\n6) If Company reports \\u2018combined\\u2019 values of \\u2018Operating Lease and Other Obligations\\u2019 under Contractual Obligations head and reported pure Operating Lease Obligations under commitments, we need to consider pure Operating Lease obligations for OLOs from commitments. We have to ignore combined values (i.e. Operating Lease & Other Obligations) from Contractual Obligations.  No need to tag calculated values for CONTR\\u2019s in this case. \\n7) If company has reported pure \\u201cOperating Lease obligation\\u201d, but not having full length maturities (i.e. 4th year and thereafter etc.) and also reported \\u201cOperating Lease & other obligations\\u201d with full length maturities; we can collect pure \\u201cOperating Lease obligations\\u201d with the available future maturities.\\n8) If company has reported pure operating lease information in description form with monthly or yearly payments along with expiry date (Where we need to do calculation here); and also reported combined values of operating lease and other obligations at another head (in year wise or range wise maturities), here we can collect combined values of operating lease and other obligations for OLOs. No need to tag calculated values for OLO\\u2019s in this case.\\n(We should collect Royalty agreements, Software Data Licenses, Programming Commitments and Concession Fees for CONTRs, if these are reported under Contractual Obligations head.)\\n9.

We need to collect this data item in all Annuals and for only in Highest PEO.\\n2. This is Income Statement Nature Data item\\n3. We need to collect this data item in all templates \\n4. Other than document currency also we need to collect for this data item in the absence of reported currency\\nCollection policy:\\nWe are collecting data based on below accounting GAAP:      \\n1. Operating lease commitments-off-balance sheet (other than US GAAP i.e. IFRS)\\n2. Operating lease Commitments-On& off-balance sheet (US GAAP)\\n -off-balance sheet includes short Term Leases and Low Value leases\\n  -On-balance sheet includes operating lease obligations recognized in the balance sheet\\nTagging:\\nOperating Lease Obligations for future years 1- 5 are collected as OLO \\u2013 OLO5, thereafter portion as OLOR, and Total as TOLO.  \\nIn the case of the US GAAP, imputed interest (difference between minimum lease and balance sheet value) for PVAOL \\n\\nPoints to be considered while extracting the values (Policies): \\nI. Order of priority:\\n1. Gross Vs Net Operating Lease Obligations:\\n       a. Collect \\u201cGross Operating Lease Obligations \\u201c(before deducting Sub Lease) under OLOs.\\n       b. If company reports \\u201cNet Operating Lease Obligations \\u201c(After deducting Sub Lease), add back sublease income. \\n      c. In the absence of Gross Operating Lease Obligations (Sub Lease income not reported separately), collect Net Operating Lease Obligations, as OLOs. \\n2. Year wise Vs Range Wise Obligations\\n     a. If both year wise and range wise obligations are given preference will be given to year wise Obligations.\\n     b. In the absence of year wise, collect range wise Obligations. (We need to calculate and tag them equally as per the given range.)\\n3. Maximum Availability \\n\\n     a. If Operating Lease Obligations are reported in two places like Commitments and Contractual, extract maximum Value. \\n\\nII More than one Lease exists in the document:\\n1) If more than one lease exits in the document, collect sum of all operating lease obligations.\\n2) When two or more Leases exist in the document, but Obligations are reported for only one lease then we can tag partial Lease Obligations for OLOs.\\n\\nIII Thereafter Policy:\\n1)If company reports maturities for undefined periods starting below 5 years like \\u2018due after one year\\u2019 or \\u2018due more than 2 years\\u2019 or \\u20183rd year and beyond\\u2019 etc., we collect the same with obligations \\u2018After 5 Years\\u2019 data item for all these data sets (i.e. OLOs, LTDs/LTDBs, CLs/LTDCs, TLTDs/TLTDBs, CONTRs and SIOLs). \\n2) When \\u20185th and Thereafter\\u2019 portion is together reported in notes, but in some other place we know the \\u2018thereafter\\u2019 portion value, then we can calculate and tag \\u20185th year\\u2019 and \\u2018Thereafter\\u2019 separately. \\n3) When \\u2018Total\\u2019 and \\u2018Up to 5 years\\u2019 Obligations are reported where \\u2018Total\\u2019 is not matching with the sum of Obligations, then we can tag difference amount as OLOR. \\n4) In Commitments, Year wise Obligations are available up to 5 years where \\u2018Total\\u2019 and \\u2018Thereafter\\u2019 portion is not reported, then check if Obligations match with Contractual. If they match, extract \\u2018Thereafter\\u2019 portion from Contractual Table. \\n5) In the US GAAP, current and non-current portion only reported in the balance sheet or notes then collect current portion for OLO and non-current portion for OLOR \\nIV TOLO:\\n1) Obligations are reported including Total for one Lease and Only Total for another Lease. \\na. Obligations including Total reported \\u2013 OLO for year wise obligations & TOLO for Total. \\nb. Only Total reported \\u2013 Only TOLO for the total. \\n2) Note - In this case, the sum of year wise obligations extracted will not match with the extracted Total. \\n3) Two Leases exist in the document. One Lease has Obligations and Total and another Lease has only Obligations (total is not reported). In this case we can tag calculated value for TOLO. \\n4) When reported total is not matching with the Obligations and \\n      a. If total > obligations, tag reported Total as TOLO. \\n      b. If total < obligations, ignore Total. \\n5) In Commitments, Year wise Obligations are reported up to thereafter, but total is not reported. In Contractual total is reported but it is not matching with the calculated total in commitments.\\n     In this case we can\\u2019t tag Total. (Even with difference of 1). Tag Total when the calculated Total matches with the reported total \\nV Other Policies: \\n1. Collect only continued operations. \\n  When combined values of Continued and Discontinued Operations are reported and segregation of the same is not possible then we need to ignore such data.  \\n2. Cancellable and Non \\u2013 Cancellable\\nWe will consider Cancellable and Non-Cancellable Operating leases under OLOs. Preference should be given to combined values.\\n3. Subsequent Event\\nWe should collect values for OLO\\u2019s even for subsequent event information reported by the Company. \\n\\n4. Country Specific\\nJapan\\n While processing Japanese documents, company reports \\u2018obligations for finance lease\\u2019 under Notes and specifies that \\u2018ownership will not be transferred to the lessee\\u2019. In this case, we have to consider such Finance lease obligations as Operating Lease (OLO\\u2019s).\\nFinland\\nWhile processing Finland country documents, company reports \\u2018lease obligations\\u2019 under the \\u2018Contingent Liabilities\\u2019 head. We should consider such values as Operating Lease (OLO\\u2019s).\\nCountry specific (Chinese) :  Need to update all obligations related data set\\n \\nWe observed that Chinese years (which is calculated from 1912)  are reported in the documents and  same numbers are translated which creates difficulty for users to recognize the English calendar year.\\nFor instance \\u2018Republic of China 103 annual (Chinese string: \\u6c11\\u570b103\\u5e74\\u5ea6)\\u2019 or  \\u2018103 (Chinese string: \\u4e00\\u25cb\\u4e09) for the English Calendar year 2014 (1911+103 =2014).\\n \\nNote: Translation changes have been done until year 2050 by the linguist.\\n \\nExample:\\n \\n# No Chinese Translation finalized\\n1 101\\u5e74 \\n2 102\\u5e74 2013\\n3 103\\u5e74 2014\\n4 104\\u5e74 20122015\\n5 105\\u5e74 2016\\n6 106\\u5e74 2017\\n\\n5. Zero Tagging Policy:\\nWe should tag Zero for OLO\\u2019s when company reports \\u2018No lease exists\\u2019 or \\u2018Future total Operating Lease Obligations as Zero\\u2019. \\n6. Expiry Dates:\\nWe should not consider expiry dates, when Lease obligations reported year wise / range wise.\\nIn absence of Year wise/range wise obligations, we can consider expiry dates for tagging OLO\\u2019s. \\n7. Month to month basis:\\nIf company reports monthly future payments of operating lease, then we are required to do calculation for future periods based on lease entering period and lease expiry dates. \\n8. Operating lease & Other\\n1) When pure Operating Lease obligations are reported, collect only 'Operating Lease Obligations' with OLOs and ignore 'Operating Lease & Other Obligations'.\\n2) When pure Operating Lease obligations are not reported, collect \\u2018Operating Lease & Other Obligations' with OLOs (only in the case of combined obligations). \\n3) If company reports \\u201cGround/Land Lease/\\u201d, consider them for OLO\\u2019s\\n4) In all the below cases, we need to collect the as reported obligations for Operating Lease related set of data items.\\n\\u2022 In some documents, companies reported operating lease obligations inclusive of deferred rent values, etc. and relevant information is reporting under sub-notes and in other areas.\\n\\u2022 Some of the companies are reporting operating lease obligations inclusive of provisions & on-balance sheet items. \\n\\nOther points in line with Revised Policy:\\n1) If company reports only Rental Obligations, we need to collect these values with OLOs. \\n2) If company reports both \\u201cRental Obligations\\u201d and \\u201cOperating Lease\\u201d separately, we have to consider both under OLOs. If company reports combined values of \\u201cOperating Lease and Rental obligations\\u201d, we need to collect combined values with OLOs. \\n3) If company has reported combined obligations i.e. \\u201cRental & Other Obligations\\u201d; we have to consider it under OLOs.\\n4) If company has reported combined obligations i.e. Rental & Others Obligations; also reported pure \\u201cOperating Lease obligations\\u201d; we have to consider both under OLOs.\\n5) If company reports two Operating Leases, one is pure Operating Lease and the other is combined with Other Obligations, then we need to tag both line items with OLOs.\\n6) If Company reports \\u2018combined\\u2019 values of \\u2018Operating Lease and Other Obligations\\u2019 under Contractual Obligations head and reported pure Operating Lease Obligations under commitments, we need to consider pure Operating Lease obligations for OLOs from commitments. We have to ignore combined values (i.e. Operating Lease & Other Obligations) from Contractual Obligations.  No need to tag calculated values for CONTR\\u2019s in this case. \\n7) If company has reported pure \\u201cOperating Lease obligation\\u201d, but not having full length maturities (i.e. 4th year and thereafter etc.) and also reported \\u201cOperating Lease & other obligations\\u201d with full length maturities; we can collect pure \\u201cOperating Lease obligations\\u201d with the available future maturities.\\n8) If company has reported pure operating lease information in description form with monthly or yearly payments along with expiry date (Where we need to do calculation here); and also reported combined values of operating lease and other obligations at another head (in year wise or range wise maturities), here we can collect combined values of operating lease and other obligations for OLOs. No need to tag calculated values for OLO\\u2019s in this case.\\n(We should collect Royalty agreements, Software Data Licenses, Programming Commitments and Concession Fees for CONTRs, if these are reported under Contractual Obligations head.)\\n9. Combined values of Capital and Operating Lease:\\n1. We should collect combined value in USGAAP document only for OLO\\u2019s\\n10.

We need to collect this data item in all Annuals and for only in Highest PEO.\\n2. This is Income Statement Nature Data item\\n3. We need to collect this data item in all templates \\n4. Other than document currency also we need to collect for this data item in the absence of reported currency\\nCollection policy:\\nWe are collecting data based on below accounting GAAP:      \\n1. Operating lease commitments-off-balance sheet (other than US GAAP i.e. IFRS)\\n2. Operating lease Commitments-On& off-balance sheet (US GAAP)\\n -off-balance sheet includes short Term Leases and Low Value leases\\n  -On-balance sheet includes operating lease obligations recognized in the balance sheet\\nTagging:\\nOperating Lease Obligations for future years 1- 5 are collected as OLO \\u2013 OLO5, thereafter portion as OLOR, and Total as TOLO.  \\nIn the case of the US GAAP, imputed interest (difference between minimum lease and balance sheet value) for PVAOL \\n\\nPoints to be considered while extracting the values (Policies): \\nI. Order of priority:\\n1. Gross Vs Net Operating Lease Obligations:\\n       a. Collect \\u201cGross Operating Lease Obligations \\u201c(before deducting Sub Lease) under OLOs.\\n       b. If company reports \\u201cNet Operating Lease Obligations \\u201c(After deducting Sub Lease), add back sublease income. \\n      c. In the absence of Gross Operating Lease Obligations (Sub Lease income not reported separately), collect Net Operating Lease Obligations, as OLOs. \\n2. Year wise Vs Range Wise Obligations\\n     a. If both year wise and range wise obligations are given preference will be given to year wise Obligations.\\n     b. In the absence of year wise, collect range wise Obligations. (We need to calculate and tag them equally as per the given range.)\\n3. Maximum Availability \\n\\n     a. If Operating Lease Obligations are reported in two places like Commitments and Contractual, extract maximum Value. \\n\\nII More than one Lease exists in the document:\\n1) If more than one lease exits in the document, collect sum of all operating lease obligations.\\n2) When two or more Leases exist in the document, but Obligations are reported for only one lease then we can tag partial Lease Obligations for OLOs.\\n\\nIII Thereafter Policy:\\n1)If company reports maturities for undefined periods starting below 5 years like \\u2018due after one year\\u2019 or \\u2018due more than 2 years\\u2019 or \\u20183rd year and beyond\\u2019 etc., we collect the same with obligations \\u2018After 5 Years\\u2019 data item for all these data sets (i.e. OLOs, LTDs/LTDBs, CLs/LTDCs, TLTDs/TLTDBs, CONTRs and SIOLs). \\n2) When \\u20185th and Thereafter\\u2019 portion is together reported in notes, but in some other place we know the \\u2018thereafter\\u2019 portion value, then we can calculate and tag \\u20185th year\\u2019 and \\u2018Thereafter\\u2019 separately. \\n3) When \\u2018Total\\u2019 and \\u2018Up to 5 years\\u2019 Obligations are reported where \\u2018Total\\u2019 is not matching with the sum of Obligations, then we can tag difference amount as OLOR. \\n4) In Commitments, Year wise Obligations are available up to 5 years where \\u2018Total\\u2019 and \\u2018Thereafter\\u2019 portion is not reported, then check if Obligations match with Contractual. If they match, extract \\u2018Thereafter\\u2019 portion from Contractual Table. \\n5) In the US GAAP, current and non-current portion only reported in the balance sheet or notes then collect current portion for OLO and non-current portion for OLOR \\nIV TOLO:\\n1) Obligations are reported including Total for one Lease and Only Total for another Lease. \\na. Obligations including Total reported \\u2013 OLO for year wise obligations & TOLO for Total. \\nb. Only Total reported \\u2013 Only TOLO for the total. \\n2) Note - In this case, the sum of year wise obligations extracted will not match with the extracted Total. \\n3) Two Leases exist in the document. One Lease has Obligations and Total and another Lease has only Obligations (total is not reported). In this case we can tag calculated value for TOLO. \\n4) When reported total is not matching with the Obligations and \\n      a. If total > obligations, tag reported Total as TOLO. \\n      b. If total < obligations, ignore Total. \\n5) In Commitments, Year wise Obligations are reported up to thereafter, but total is not reported. In Contractual total is reported but it is not matching with the calculated total in commitments.\\n     In this case we can\\u2019t tag Total. (Even with difference of 1). Tag Total when the calculated Total matches with the reported total \\nV Other Policies: \\n1. Collect only continued operations. \\n  When combined values of Continued and Discontinued Operations are reported and segregation of the same is not possible then we need to ignore such data.  \\n2. Cancellable and Non \\u2013 Cancellable\\nWe will consider Cancellable and Non-Cancellable Operating leases under OLOs. Preference should be given to combined values.\\n3. Subsequent Event\\nWe should collect values for OLO\\u2019s even for subsequent event information reported by the Company. \\n\\n4. Country Specific\\nJapan\\n While processing Japanese documents, company reports \\u2018obligations for finance lease\\u2019 under Notes and specifies that \\u2018ownership will not be transferred to the lessee\\u2019. In this case, we have to consider such Finance lease obligations as Operating Lease (OLO\\u2019s).\\nFinland\\nWhile processing Finland country documents, company reports \\u2018lease obligations\\u2019 under the \\u2018Contingent Liabilities\\u2019 head. We should consider such values as Operating Lease (OLO\\u2019s).\\nCountry specific (Chinese) :  Need to update all obligations related data set\\n \\nWe observed that Chinese years (which is calculated from 1912)  are reported in the documents and  same numbers are translated which creates difficulty for users to recognize the English calendar year.\\nFor instance \\u2018Republic of China 103 annual (Chinese string: \\u6c11\\u570b103\\u5e74\\u5ea6)\\u2019 or  \\u2018103 (Chinese string: \\u4e00\\u25cb\\u4e09) for the English Calendar year 2014 (1911+103 =2014).\\n \\nNote: Translation changes have been done until year 2050 by the linguist.\\n \\nExample:\\n \\n# No Chinese Translation finalized\\n1 101\\u5e74 \\n2 102\\u5e74 2013\\n3 103\\u5e74 2014\\n4 104\\u5e74 20122015\\n5 105\\u5e74 2016\\n6 106\\u5e74 2017\\n\\n5. Zero Tagging Policy:\\nWe should tag Zero for OLO\\u2019s when company reports \\u2018No lease exists\\u2019 or \\u2018Future total Operating Lease Obligations as Zero\\u2019. \\n6. Expiry Dates:\\nWe should not consider expiry dates, when Lease obligations reported year wise / range wise.\\nIn absence of Year wise/range wise obligations, we can consider expiry dates for tagging OLO\\u2019s. \\n7. Month to month basis:\\nIf company reports monthly future payments of operating lease, then we are required to do calculation for future periods based on lease entering period and lease expiry dates. \\n8. Operating lease & Other\\n1) When pure Operating Lease obligations are reported, collect only 'Operating Lease Obligations' with OLOs and ignore 'Operating Lease & Other Obligations'.\\n2) When pure Operating Lease obligations are not reported, collect \\u2018Operating Lease & Other Obligations' with OLOs (only in the case of combined obligations). \\n3) If company reports \\u201cGround/Land Lease/\\u201d, consider them for OLO\\u2019s\\n4) In all the below cases, we need to collect the as reported obligations for Operating Lease related set of data items.\\n\\u2022 In some documents, companies reported operating lease obligations inclusive of deferred rent values, etc. and relevant information is reporting under sub-notes and in other areas.\\n\\u2022 Some of the companies are reporting operating lease obligations inclusive of provisions & on-balance sheet items. \\n\\nOther points in line with Revised Policy:\\n1) If company reports only Rental Obligations, we need to collect these values with OLOs. \\n2) If company reports both \\u201cRental Obligations\\u201d and \\u201cOperating Lease\\u201d separately, we have to consider both under OLOs. If company reports combined values of \\u201cOperating Lease and Rental obligations\\u201d, we need to collect combined values with OLOs. \\n3) If company has reported combined obligations i.e. \\u201cRental & Other Obligations\\u201d; we have to consider it under OLOs.\\n4) If company has reported combined obligations i.e. Rental & Others Obligations; also reported pure \\u201cOperating Lease obligations\\u201d; we have to consider both under OLOs.\\n5) If company reports two Operating Leases, one is pure Operating Lease and the other is combined with Other Obligations, then we need to tag both line items with OLOs.\\n6) If Company reports \\u2018combined\\u2019 values of \\u2018Operating Lease and Other Obligations\\u2019 under Contractual Obligations head and reported pure Operating Lease Obligations under commitments, we need to consider pure Operating Lease obligations for OLOs from commitments. We have to ignore combined values (i.e. Operating Lease & Other Obligations) from Contractual Obligations.  No need to tag calculated values for CONTR\\u2019s in this case. \\n7) If company has reported pure \\u201cOperating Lease obligation\\u201d, but not having full length maturities (i.e. 4th year and thereafter etc.) and also reported \\u201cOperating Lease & other obligations\\u201d with full length maturities; we can collect pure \\u201cOperating Lease obligations\\u201d with the available future maturities.\\n8) If company has reported pure operating lease information in description form with monthly or yearly payments along with expiry date (Where we need to do calculation here); and also reported combined values of operating lease and other obligations at another head (in year wise or range wise maturities), here we can collect combined values of operating lease and other obligations for OLOs. No need to tag calculated values for OLO\\u2019s in this case.\\n(We should collect Royalty agreements, Software Data Licenses, Programming Commitments and Concession Fees for CONTRs, if these are reported under Contractual Obligations head.)\\n9. Combined values of Capital and Operating Lease:\\n1. We should collect combined value in USGAAP document only for OLO\\u2019s\\n10. Original Vs Amendment\\nWhile processing the Amendment document if there is no data, then we can collect it from original if NI\\\\ Tax\\\\ are same in both documents.\\nMore than one Amendment : We always Extracts data from original only. Don\\u2019t collect data from recent amendments.\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"table_or_snippet_or_both\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Both\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"more_than_one_data_item_combined\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"No\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"search_strings\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Lease_x000D_\\nLeasing_x000D_\\nOperating lease_x000D_\\nRent_x000D_\\nRental_x000D_\\nObligation_x000D_\\nContractual\\nCommitment\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"table_section_header\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Headers_x000D_\\n_x000D_\\nAs a lessee_x000D_\\nAS LESSEE_x000D_\\nAs Lessee-Operating leases_x000D_\\nAssets taken on Lease_x000D_\\nBusiness Lease Commitment matters_x000D_\\nCharters-in_x000D_\\nCommitment under Operating Leases Where the Group Is a Lessee_x000D_\\nCommitments_x000D_\\nCommitments -
